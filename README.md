# Todo Web Backend Code

This repository contains the code for the backend of a Todo web application. It includes the routes and controllers necessary to manage and interact with todo items. This backend is designed to be used in conjunction with a frontend application to create a complete Todo web application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this backend code, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-web-backend.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up a Database**: Configure a database for storing todo items. You may need to create a database and update the configuration details in the project.

4. **Environment Variables**: Set up the required environment variables for your project, such as database connection details and any secret keys.

5. **Run the Server**: Start the server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server, and it will be accessible at a specified URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

6. **API Endpoints**: Explore and interact with the API endpoints for managing todo items. You can find the available routes and controllers in the codebase.

## API Endpoints

The backend code provides the following API endpoints for managing todo items:

- `GET /todos`: Get a list of all todo items.
- `POST /todos`: Create a new todo item.
- `GET /todos/:id`: Get a specific todo item by its ID.
- `PUT /todos/:id`: Update a todo item.
- `DELETE /todos/:id`: Delete a todo item.

Please refer to the code and documentation for more details on how to use these endpoints.

## Technologies Used

The backend code is built using Node.js and utilizes various libraries and frameworks, including but not limited to:

- Express.js: A popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing todo items.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
